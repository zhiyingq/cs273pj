# cs273pj
This is the CS273P final project of Zhiying Qian and Meng Ke.<br />
<br />
To use the code, please to to the 'src' folder and run the code by jupyter notebook. The 'data_loader.py' is the data loader tool provided by TA. The 'data_loader_df.py' is a helper program written by Zhiying Qian and Meng Ke, which uses the functions defined in 'load_loader.py' and re-processes the data. Zhiying Qian's contribution is in the 'adult_lc_nn_svm_esb.ipynb' file, which implements the linear classification, nerual network, svm and ensemble. Meng Ke's contribution is in the 'adult_rf.ipynb' file, which implements the decision tree and random forest model.  <br />
All the training, validation and test data is in the 'data' folder.
